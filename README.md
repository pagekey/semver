# pagekey-semver

This is a simple, opinionated semantic versioning tool.

Check out the docs site (coming soon) or the [docs site source](./docs/index.md) to learn more.

## Getting Started

1. Install the package

```bash
pip install pagekey-semver
```

2. Run the dry run to see what will happen.

```bash
pagekey-semver plan
```

3. Run it for real to tag and push!

```bash
pagekey-semver apply
```

## Usage

As you'll see below, it's highly recommended to set the `SEMVER_TOKEN` variable to your push credential, as well as `SEMVER_USER` if applicable for your Git hosting platform.

### GitHub Actions

The simplest way to get started is to paste the following workflow into a file such as `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

```yaml
name: Run semantic version process.

on: [push]

jobs:
  version:
    uses: pagekey/semver/.github/workflows/semver.yml@main
```

If you want to specify which user is used to push, you can use the following snippet. You must create the `SEMVER_USER` and `SEMVER_TOKEN` secrets. You can use a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) set as a repo or organization [secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions). If you'd rather not use your personal account for the PAT, you can use a bot account.

```yaml
name: Run semantic version process.

on: [push]

jobs:
  version:
    uses: pagekey/semver/.github/workflows/semver.yml@main
    with:
      SEMVER_USER: ${{ secrets.SEMVER_USER }}
      SEMVER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SEMVER_TOKEN }}
```

Beware that GitHub does **not** trigger a pipeline on tags pushed from Actions (or at least, I couldn't figure out how to get it to do that.)

If you want to trigger another workflow only when a tag has been created, you can use the following, combining `needs` and `if` to check:

```yaml
jobs:
  # ...
  # omitting inclusion of semver.yml shown above
  # ...

  publish:
    needs: version
    if: ${{ needs.version.outputs.semver_release_occurred == 'true' }}
    steps:
      # Do anything that should only occur on new tags, such as publishing/deploying your code.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### GitLab CI/CD

GitLab CI/CD is a bit more straightforward than GitHub Actions for this package. There is no restriction on running pipelines that have been created automatically, so a tag pipeline will run when the package pushes. Use the following snippet in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to get started. Be sure to set `SEMVER_USER` and `SEMVER_TOKEN`. For user, you can use `oauth2`, `gitlab-ci-token`, or your username. For the token, use a personal or group access token.

Note that `only` and `except` are deprecated, but are included here for simplicity. You can migrate to `rules` if you would like.

```yaml
stages:
  - version


semver-dry-run:
  stage: version
  image: python:3.10
  except: [main, tags]
  script:
    - pip install pagekey-semver
    - pagekey-semver plan

semver:
  stage: version
  image: python:3.10
  only: [main]
  script:
    - pip install pagekey-semver
    - pagekey-semver plan
```


## Philosophy

This is an opinionated version of Semantic Release that loosely follows the guidelines at [semver.org](https://semver.org/). It puts practicality above all theory. There is no special treatment of "pre-releases", versions prior to `v1.0.0`. Everything behaves the same: patch prefixes increment the third number, minor patches increment the middle number, and major prefixes increment the first number. If there are multiple prefixes, the prefix with the greatest precedence is applied. If you don't like the default settings, you can override them using the configuration format below.

This package is intended to run on a Linux system with the `bash` shell installed.


## Configuration
